### I watched the Barbie movie. I thought it was great.
Aug 8, 2023

I don't really like movies, I rarely watch them. My favourite movies are Inside Out and Instant Family. That should tell you a lot about me. I don't like being entertained and movies are for the most part a whole lot of that. As far as entertainment goes, barbie was run of the mill. Exposition, conflict, climax, denouement. Rinse and repeat. It got boring and I wanted to do something more valuable, my experience with most movies, whatever. But I did leave my illegally streamed movie theater cam recording session with gratitude at the predicted impact this movie will have on culture. And <em><strong>that</strong></em> is why I thought it was great.

America is the only place in the world that this movie could have ever been created. The freest nation in the history of nations. It could have only been there. I would like to have an american passport for exactly this reason (residence by investment ftw), even if it's not my first choice of residence. I was commenting this to my friend Cadin, nowhere else in the world could this movie have been not just created, but experienced by so many minds. ($1B box office milestone reached as of yesterday (2023 dollars)). That's something to be in awe of. Even if america is declining, which I am currently leaning towards believing is the case, its immense beauty, power, and ability to think has to be appreciated.

##### I'm going to now give my thoughts on the movie, if you don't want spoilers, stop reading. 

I'll start by acknowledging that I felt personally attacked by the depiction of Ken. Haha, obviously right! It was hard for me to have a mirror held up to my life, especially of the first stage of Ken where he can best be described as a simp. We will call him Simp Ken And less so but still, by the second stage of Ken which we will call Insecure Alpha Ken (or IAK). I've never been the guy that gets cute girls, I've never been the popular guy, so to see Simp Ken first of all portrayed so parodically and second of all dismissed so easily by Barbie and her friends, shined a light on one of my deepest insecurities. Luckily I'm a gigachad and this didn't stop me from continuing to watch the film. (should we even call movies films any more? or for that matter movies?) (seems to me like movies are just a style of video at this point in history. Music video, vlog, video essay, long form story video with soundstrack, haha.)

However, I recognize that the various stages of Ken are a large part of what women deal with every day of their lives. It seems like the creators wanted to tell the truth as they saw it, and I'm grateful that they didn't hold back. To be more precise, Barbie The Movie, let me see the world through the eyes of women in a way I have never had the opportunity to. I've recently started getting really into Empathy, so this was thoroughly enjoyable for me. As I was watching the long video, I found myself wanting to help create a world where girls have the maximal opportunity to be whoever they want to be. This was already part of my life goal, but it definetely made me want to do it more. I expect that to be the case for men all around the world, and even if they don't go that far and the film helped them increase their understanding of women, this is a huge win.

So here I will give you a prompt to memetically proliferate inside your mind. Accept it if you dare. Muawhahahaa.

Jk. How can we create a world where women are given the most amount of freedom and resources possible to be who they want to be?

Feel free to reach out to me with some ideas if you'd like to.

Continuing on, I really enjoy the concept of empathy. To me, empathy can also be described as: one's ability to accurately model another conscious being's experience. The better one can model, the higher their empathy. The fantastic thing is, this means empathy is an increasable skill. And if we can increase a skill, then we can create technologies to scale that increase optimally. I want that to be part of my life mission. I think that creating empathy increasing technologies is probably one of the most important things we can do at this point in history. For human - human coordination/alignment, for human - ai coordination/alignment, and whatever other conscious beings are added into the mix in the coming future, it seems to me an essentiality of creating a future that is good.

I really like the idea of the neuralink and brain machine interfaces. I am theorizing that it is possible to digitally model and render our own awarenesses, have all of our memories stored, as well as the way we experience those memories, the way we understand the world, what words mean to us, what actions mean to us, etc. Everything that we could classify as making a person different from another person. If this is truly possible, and it seems we will find out in the next 10-15 years, then I am hoping it will be possible to be able to package that into an experiencable experience. Like a 4d immersive video. Maybe you fully become that person for a couple minutes or hours, or maybe there is a less immersive option where you are just observing but your understanding has increased by orders of magnitude. You can replay scenese you'd like to better understand, you can share or upload your own. Who knows what it will look like. I'm not sure. Maybe there is a great to increase empathy that doesn't require us to wait 10 years and is less complex. Let's make this a point of focus and iterate forward.

So here's another prompt. How can we create technologies to maximally increase our empathy individually and thus collectively? What is the optimal route to get there?



- didn't like that masculinity was not given a constructive vision
