### I watched the Barbie movie. I thought it was great.
Aug 8, 2023

I don't really like movies, I rarely watch them. My favourite movies are Inside Out and Instant Family. That should tell you a lot about me. I don't like being entertained and movies are for the most part a whole lot of that. As far as entertainment goes, barbie was run of the mill. Exposition, conflict, climax, denouement. Rinse and repeat. It got boring and I wanted to do something more valuable, my experience with most movies, whatever. But I did leave my illegally streamed movie theater cam recording session with gratitude at the predicted impact this movie will have on culture. And <em><strong>that</strong></em> is why I thought it was great.

America is the only place in the world that this movie could have ever been created. The freest nation in the history of nations. It could have only been there. I would like to have an american passport for exactly this reason (residence by investment ftw), even if it's not my first choice of residence. I was commenting this to my friend Cadin, nowhere else in the world could this movie have been not just created, but experienced by so many minds. ($1B box office milestone reached as of yesterday (2023 dollars)). That's something to be in awe of. Even if america is declining, which I am currently leaning towards believing is the case, its immense beauty, power, and ability to think has to be appreciated.

##### I'm going to now give my thoughts on the movie, if you don't want spoilers, stop reading. 

I'll start by acknowledging that I felt personally attacked by the depiction of Ken. Haha, obviously right! It was hard for me to have a mirror held up to my life, especially of the first stage of Ken where he can best be described as a simp. We will call him Simp Ken And less so but still, by the second stage of Ken which we will call Insecure Alpha Ken (or IAK). I've never been the guy that gets cute girls, I've never been the popular guy, so to see Simp Ken first of all portrayed and second of all dismissed so easily by Barbie and her friends, shined a light on one of my deepest insecurities. Luckily I'm a gigachad and this didn't stop me from continuing to watch the film. (should we even call movies films any more? or for that matter movies?) (seems to me like movies are just a style of video at this point in history. Music video, vlog, video essay, long form story video with soundstrack, haha.) 

- didn't like that masculinity was not given a constructive vision
- felt personally attacked
- made me have more empathy towards women
- how can we create technologies to increase our empathy individually and thus collectively
- how can we create a world where women are given the most amount of freedom possible to be who they want to be
