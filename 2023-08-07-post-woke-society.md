## I watched the Barbie movie. I thought it was great.

I don't really like movies, I rarely watch them. My favourite movies are Inside Out and Instant Family. That should tell you a lot about me. I don't like being entertained and movies are for the most part a whole lot of that. As far as entertainment goes, barbie was run of the mill. Exposition, conflict, climax, denouement. Rinse and repeat. It got boring and I wanted to do something more valuable, my experience with most movies, whatever. But I did leave my illegally streamed movie theater cam recording session with gratitude at the predicted impact this movie will have on culture. And <em><strong>that</strong></em> is why I thought it was great.

America is the only place in the world that this movie could have ever been created. The freest nation in the history of nations. It could only have been there. I would like to have an american passport for exactly this reason (residence by investment ftw), even if it's not my first choice of residence. I was commenting this to my friend Cadin, nowhere else in the world could this movie have been not just created, but experienced by so many minds. ($1B box office milestone reached as of yesterday (2023 dollars)). That's something to be in awe of. Even if america is declining, which I am currently leaning towards believing is the case, its immense beauty and power has to be appreciated.
